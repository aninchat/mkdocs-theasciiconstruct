# Welcome to The ASCII Construct

My name is Aninda Chatterjee and I am a network engineer. I run this site (read: blog) to share my experiences across various networking domains that I have worked in, including a wide range of technologies and solutions such as Cisco SD-Access, EVPN VXLAN data centers, network infrastructure for AI clusters.

I am a published author, having written the book *Deploying Juniper Data Centers with EVPN VXLAN*, which can be bought direct from Pearson [here](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/deploying-juniper-data-centers-with-evpn-vxlan/P200000011537/9780138225377) or from the US Amazon store [here](https://www.amazon.com/Deploying-Juniper-Data-Centers-VXLAN/dp/0138225397/ref=sr_1_2?crid=J5BJXH3VUHOA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ou4YchaaYSvREV2NRU_3xzZfKXCULI39UP7Iasj8E8mWQm1wRb8QPgNPWebx6Pi8WZMyqBAkBeX5RFKLks28Y4E3NZIM2Tw5lOujuqixNjd9WhTpl6DSeMVgm-dVNMnWGzf0JAB6MF0-DsQSnaKJ46dkHkS5kIIesE2390VzAXPdt4djZcvCUV9Rj8_MUH5sY-hHbywtcEOBZ7W9Cqa-FetUINBB7HRNgbVlVSc2pM8.zkaZPX6lFuK_2AklORt3tEv2QtcvQlNUbYQRUGHF2ns&dib_tag=se&keywords=vxlan&qid=1727973576&sprefix=vxl%2Caps%2C451&sr=8-2).
